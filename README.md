# Venice Data Portal

The Venice Data Portal will serve as a companion site for informational booklets produced by the Venice Project Center in anticipation of its 30th anniversary.

The portal will contain interactive and animated visuals, as well as a section to download the data sets collected over the past 30 years in Venice.

This site was created as part of an Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP) for Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
